/**
 * # Send reports/artifacts from testbot back to client
 *
 * By default, serial logs (given that the hardware is set up correctly), and the
 * logs from the tests will be sent back to the client that started the test, upon
 * the test finishing. Other artifacts can be sent back to the client using the
 * `archiver` method.
 *
 * The Archiver is imported into each test and hence the methods can be accessed within any test. Check
 * `test.js` to check the imports. To archive a file:
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * 	await this.Archiver.add(this.id, "Path/to/file/needs/to/be/archived");
 * ```
 *
 * To directly archive the output of a command, example: `journalctl` or `dmesg` commands. Use the
 * `archiveLogs` helper accessible through `worker` context.
 *
 * * @example
 * ```js
 * 	await this.context.get().worker.archiveLogs(title, target, command);
 * ```
 *
 * Using this method, at the end of the test, any artifacts added to the archive are compressed and
 * downloaded by the client. These are available in the `workspace/reports` directory at the end of
 * the test. This can also be helpful when storing artifacts/reports/logs after a test suite run.
 *
 * @module Archiver
