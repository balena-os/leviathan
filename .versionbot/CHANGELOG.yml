    - subject: "worker: extend total flashing timeout to 25 minutes"
      hash: 14f4119c37326f4f1bc1c2c5e5df243b6819d945
      body: |
        The total flashing time used to be:

        30 tries × 25 seconds = 750 seconds (12.5 minutes)

        This used to be on the limit of timeout for slowish SD cards and secure
        boot flashers that need to boot and re-program

        It's now double that time:

        60 tries × 25 seconds = 1,500 seconds (25 minutes)

      hash: ba51cc72a4ccf098af5d969ed8d7aeb08e009755
      body: |
        These contracts used to be copied to the core service at build
        time if private device types cloned the repo before running test suites.

        However, since switching to pre-built images by default we need to
        manually mount private contracts to the core service.

    - subject: Enable selection of workers with locked DUT in secureboot tests
      hash: 92972900c54a2f0ea9a1b7e41f83adc6c32cafe0
      body: >
        This will make the client look for workers with a "DUT: <deviceType>-sb"
        tag if FLASHER_SECUREBOOT=1 when starting tests. This is to enable
        differentiation between locked and unlocked DUTs for device types that
        support secureboot.

        the function that was being used to fetch the DUT ip from the worker had
        nested retries that led to 30x5 = 150 retries, and timeouts taking ~40
        mins in the case the DUT wasn't reachable (autokit setup fault, device
        not booting, problem during flashing). This removes the nested retries
        and reduces the retries to 50 /  ~ 10mins

    - subject: "client: use /start endpoint of worker to reserve worker if IDLE
        immediately"
      hash: 41b535e9ad160a6c663cf39137da562b4843829a
      body: >
        There is a problem where if the multiple jobs are running at the same
        time, all waiting for a worker to be IDLE, multiple jobs start using the
        worker at the same time. The reason was that first, the state of the
        worker is polled using /state - then, after some delay, it is reserved
        using the /start endpoint. Problem 1 was that there is a delay between
        checking and reserving - leading to a window of time where another job
        could do the same thing. Problem 2 is that once /start was used, there
        was nothing to stop the client from continuing, even if the worker was
        BUSY. This commit forgoes the /state endpoint, and just skips to trying
        /start - if the worker is IDLE, its instanly reserved, if its BUSY, the
        reponse is actually checked and nothing happens.

      hash: 70674774a7652a9e7766710bc74a829cd1156aa0
      body: >
        Read the suite configuration for the force migration flag which
        configures

        the flasher image to force an installer migration.


        With the current QEMU setting, `installerForceMigration` alone is not

        enough and the QEMU_INTERNAL_STORAGE also needs to be set to false in

        the worker's environment so only a single external disk is attached to

        the emulator.

      hash: fc65360ae7896545bdcaad0d37f1345a447251f4
      body: |
        Some incoming tests require QEMU to exit, simulating a device powering
        off, before starting QEMU again. This is used to "reflash" a virtualized
        device before continuing with testing, for instance after tampering with
        boot files on a secure boot enabled device to verify secure boot checks.

        However, swtpm will exit when QEMU disconnects. The `--exit-code-from`
        compose argument implies `--abort-on-container-exit`, so this results
        in the test run aborting prematurely.

        Adapt the entrypoint and command of the swtpm container to always
        restart the program without exiting the container.

      body: |
        Remove try/catch block surrounding client code that blanket handles all
        exceptions, and makes debugging and log messages worse.

        When we don't have a valid way to handle an exception, just throw it.
        The traceback is more useful than the handler.

      body: |
        Not all platforms support secure boot, notably aarch64 using tianocore
        firmware. Additionally, swtpm may not be available for all platforms.
        Accordingly, move the swtpm service to a separate compose file that is
        only used when secure boot is enabled.

        as suites can install npm packages at runtime.

        Hardcoding the bridge address like this results in conflicts
        when multiple instances are running on one jenkins node.

        A new solution for local workstation testing will have to be
        considered.

        Instead of retrying to get the DUT IP address 120 times on a 1 seconds interval,
        let's reduce it to 30 times because the resolveLocalTarget which we call will
        timeout too in 15 seconds:

        https://github.com/balena-os/leviathan-worker/blob/master/lib/helpers/index.ts#L162

        So reducing the retries number to 30 will effectly bring the total combined timeout to a maximum of 8 minutes.

      hash: 2f2d7a8b99fcaffc22d0032f9102e194160f7e1f
      body: |
        The executeCommand family of methods default to retrying on failure. In
        some cases, such as in the ssh-auth test in the cloud test suite, we
        expect failures to happen, and want them to be raised immediately. Other
        situations might demand adjusting the number of retries and interval to
        fit specific tests. Add a retryOptions object to these methods to allow
        for this behavior to be configured.

        worker.rebootDut() contains retry logic using utils.waitUntil() wrapping
        this.executeCommandInHostOS(). The latter contains its own retry logic,
        which will try to execute a given command for up to five minutes before
        timing out. Remove the retry logic from worker.rebootDut(), as it's
        redundant and adds latency.

        Create a directConnect variable that indicates whether we're connecting
        to a local instance of the worker server, including if the connection is
        over a unix domain socket. This allows the suite to skip steps that
        don't pertain to local runs.

      body: |
        Network configuration, including creating a bridge, setting iptables
        rules, and running a DHCP server, requires privileges. This can be done
        easily in a container, but would otherwise necessitate running the whole
        test suite privileged, or with CAP_NET_ADMIN at least.

        Allow users to disable network autoconfiguration in favor of manually
        setting up a bridge and DHCP server separately. This allows the suite to
        be run unprivileged, if necessary.

        The compose project name is used to prefix all components of the

        If we are running on Jenkins it would be best to avoid having all builds
        using the same default prefix "leviathan-" since they are sharing
        a docker host.

- commits:

        Older TS versions typed objects passed to exception handlers as `any`,
        regardless of the fact that it's not guaranteed these objects inherit
        from the Error prototype. Newer TS versions throw an error because the
        type is unknown:
        worker/lib/index.ts:282:25 - error TS2571: Object is of type 'unknown'.
        Fix this error by checking that the object passed to the error handler
        is indeed an instance of Error before accessing the message property.

        When debug is disabled, QEMU's stdio is piped to the parent process. If

        waiting for the pipe buffer to accept more data.
        Override the default and ignore stdio when debug is not enabled to
        prevent this.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        Refactor Teardown class as TaskQueue to facilitate registering tasks for
        setup as well as teardown. A separate Teardown object inherits from
        TaskQueue and retains the signal handling from the original object.
        This is a precursor to separating the forking behavior from the suite
        object in preparation for having a standalone runner for virtualized
        workers. For example, we can move the removeDownloads hook from the
        Suite object to a separate SuiteSubprocess object that is specifically
        for handling suites not running on a the same physical machine.

        The Test object is constructed with a Suite instance, which is
        accessible from inside tests using 'this.suite'. However, another object
        is created using only certain properties from the input suite object.
        Remove the intermediate object so that all properties from the suite
        object are exposed in the test code.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        The BalenaOS object has a fetch() method that unpacks a compressed disk
        image from an input path to a destination path, called "path". The
        destination is currently pulled from a config file.
        We don't need to retain the extracted image, so switch to a temp file
        path, which makes this bit of configuration unnecessary.

        QEMU can accept firmware blobs for different architectures, machine
        types, and feature sets (e.g., secure boot). OVMF is a commonly
        available firmware implementing the UEFI specification for virtual
        machines based on edk2.
        Various distributions package and ship OVMF firmware, but with varying
        paths between them. Allow for user defined paths to firmware files,
        instead of a static path.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        Previously, the worker would exit with an error if the server address
        was a string, instead of an object describing a TCP socket.
        Unfortunately, a string is a valid address in the case of listening to a
        UNIX domain socket. Remove this error condition, as the server will
        raise an error anyway if the port cannot be used.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        Compose v2.2 seems to no longer support device_cgroup_rules
        configuration. This was removed in Compose file v3, but it still doesn't
        work with Compose v2.2 even when using the older Compose file v2.4
        that's supposed to support it. Revert to a known good version of
        compose.

    - subject: "workers: qemu: make kvm optional"
- commits:
    - body: |-
        KVM requires support from the CPU, BIOS/firmware, and hypervisor to all
        be enabled. In the case where support is missing or disabled in any of
        these places, KVM cannot be used. If the device node is missing,
        attempting to map it in the compose file will fail, and the worker
        cannot be started.
        Instead, set a device cgroup policy to allow our container to create and
        access the required device nodes at runtime if KVM is supported. This
        allows a fallback to software emulation when KVM is not available. It
        also allows for software emulation of targets not matching the host
        architecture.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        QEMU is able to optionally use OVMF firmware, built from Tianocore edk2,
        to support UEFI. QEMU can be told to load OVMF firmware using a number
        of methods, not all of which fully support persistent UEFI variables,
        such as are required by secure boot.
        Switch from using the -bios flag to fully emulated pflash to load OVMF,
        including support for persistent UEFI variables. Also switch from the pc
        machine to q35, which is required for fully emulated pflash.
        https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/e1e7306b54147e65cb7347b060e94f336d4a82d2/OvmfPkg/README#L65

- commits:
    - body: |-
        When we removed the dependency on glider in the proxy tests, we also
        removed glider from the worker. However, older versions of the tests
        from ESR branches would still call this endpoint and expect a sane
        response.
        Fortunately, the old proxy tests were invalid and would always pass
        even if glider wasn't working. ICMP traffic does not use the proxy.
        So, we can just pretend to start a glider instance so the old tests
        continue to run, even with an invalid result.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        Dnsmasq can be configured (and already is) to only listen on specific
        interfaces—for DHCP. By default, it will still listen on port 53 for DNS
        queries, which makes it impossible to run multiple instances
        concurrently.
        From the man page:
        -p, --port=<port>
        Listen on <port> instead of the standard DNS port (53). Setting this to
        zero completely disables DNS function, leaving only DHCP and/or TFTP.
        Specify --port=0 to disable DNS, and allow multiple instances to run
        concurrently.

        and supported versions of Node.
        Spawn QEMU directly using child_process.spawn(). Setup networking
        through a bridge and qemu-bridge-helper, rather than libvirt.

    - subject: "patch: Update waitUntil helper's rejection condition to default false"
- commits:
    - body: waitUntil is a helper that runs a function for a designated number of
        times till it satisfies a particular condition to break out of the loop.
        In the current implementation, if `rejectionFail` is `true` and if the
        command fails to satisfy the condition in an iteration then the
        `waitUntil` helper returns an error which isn't quite helpful for a
        function that is meant to continuously wait until something is complete.
        Hence, the change to make `rejectionFail` as default to `false` in the
        `waitUntil` helper

    - subject: Implement DeviceApplicationActionable
- commits:
    - body: |-
        The class is aimed at representing the action flow of deploying an
        application onto a balena device. From cloning all the way to waiting
        for the application to download.
        One needs to see this class as chain where each node only
        exposes the next possible set moves.

- commits:
    - body: >-
        In order to know all test requirments when we discover

        them we need to maintain the whole tree in memory.

        We need this to be able to specify contracts per test check weather we
        satisfy them

        before we run the tests. This also cleans up the test API.

    - subject: Resolve version properly
- commits:
    - body: >-
        The way we handle version today is wrong because build tags are not

        taken into account by the satisfies function of semver.

        Users can now specify keywords like: 'latest', 'recommended' or
        'default'

        to select the desired version.

- commits:

        Create OS component which provides the required configuration to run a
        specific OS.

        This class will be closely related (coupled) to the worker class. The
        flash method in the

        worker class will use the OS class to configure the image.

        The two interfaces should be kept in sync.

        Because of the move of the download function we changed the way we
        retrive the filename.

- commits:
    - body: >-
        The use of ava is becoming more of a hassle than anything.

        Ava is taking a lot of the freedom we have away and we had to

        push back on this until ava cracked.

        Node-tap seems to be a much better fit for this project as it is
        light-weight and

        highly customizable.

        and move

        back to javascript.

        This will make is easier to intercept Ava's stdin for semi-automation

        The `lib/runner.js` file is not a TypeScript file since running the
        entry point with `ts-node` yields some incomprehensible null-related
        issues with completely out of sense line numbers.

- commits:
    - subject: Add a device-type component with a default implementation
- commits:
    - body: |-
        A "device-type" component implements a "provision" function that given a
        writer, an image, and some options:
        - Flashes the image (in whatever way that makes)
        - Provisions the device (in whatever way that makes sense)
        After the provision function runs, we can expect a device to be up and
        running.
        We provide a default implementation that writes the image to a disk, and
        waits for the test runner person to manually remove the SD Card and
        complete the provisioning process.
        This commit also introduces `utils.requireComponent()`, which will try
        to find a proper implementation, or otherwise default to `default.js`.

        The resin.io platform has an interface, which consists of functions such
        as download device type OS, create an application, etc.
        This interface is implemented by the Resin SDK. In the future, we will
        implement the same interface using the Resin CLI, and even the Dashboard
        by using a browser driver technology.
