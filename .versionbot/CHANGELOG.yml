      hash: 0f4b4b55b01bbfb023bcddba0ea585bcbe968a07
      body: |
        Remove try/catch block surrounding client code that blanket handles all
        exceptions, and makes debugging and log messages worse.

        When we don't have a valid way to handle an exception, just throw it.
        The traceback is more useful than the handler.

        Not all platforms support secure boot, notably aarch64 using tianocore
        firmware. Additionally, swtpm may not be available for all platforms.
        Accordingly, move the swtpm service to a separate compose file that is
        only used when secure boot is enabled.

        This improves stage when changing node dependencies
        as it won't need to re-install or re-build the CLI stage.

        We also need to keep build dependencies in the final image
        as suites can install npm packages at runtime.

        Custom actions can only use certain secrets and single-dimension

        is successful we have a lot more options.

        This reverts commit eb69ff445fe0cac4f2060e67fa6994e61c3ca4b9.

        Hardcoding the bridge address like this results in conflicts
        when multiple instances are running on one jenkins node.

        A new solution for local workstation testing will have to be
        considered.

        Instead of retrying to get the DUT IP address 120 times on a 1 seconds
        interval,

        let's reduce it to 30 times because the resolveLocalTarget which we call will

        timeout too in 15 seconds:


        https://github.com/balena-os/leviathan-worker/blob/master/lib/helpers/index.ts#L162


        So reducing the retries number to 30 will effectly bring the total combined timeout to a maximum of 8 minutes.

        Unfortunately the standalone balena-cli package is linked to glibc
        and does not work with musl (alpine) so we need to switch to debian.

        The trade-off seems worth it for build times though.

      body: |
        The executeCommand family of methods default to retrying on failure. In
        some cases, such as in the ssh-auth test in the cloud test suite, we
        expect failures to happen, and want them to be raised immediately. Other
        situations might demand adjusting the number of retries and interval to
        fit specific tests. Add a retryOptions object to these methods to allow
        for this behavior to be configured.

      body: |
        worker.rebootDut() contains retry logic using utils.waitUntil() wrapping
        this.executeCommandInHostOS(). The latter contains its own retry logic,
        which will try to execute a given command for up to five minutes before
        timing out. Remove the retry logic from worker.rebootDut(), as it's
        redundant and adds latency.

        don't pertain to local runs.

      body: |
        Network configuration, including creating a bridge, setting iptables
        rules, and running a DHCP server, requires privileges. This can be done
        easily in a container, but would otherwise necessitate running the whole
        test suite privileged, or with CAP_NET_ADMIN at least.

        Allow users to disable network autoconfiguration in favor of manually
        setting up a bridge and DHCP server separately. This allows the suite to
        be run unprivileged, if necessary.

        The compose project name is used to prefix all components of the
        docker-compose stack, like volumes, networks, containers, etc.

        If we are running on Jenkins it would be best to avoid having all builds
        using the same default prefix "leviathan-" since they are sharing
        a docker host.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        Older TS versions typed objects passed to exception handlers as `any`,
        regardless of the fact that it's not guaranteed these objects inherit
        from the Error prototype. Newer TS versions throw an error because the
        type is unknown:
        worker/lib/index.ts:282:25 - error TS2571: Object is of type 'unknown'.
        Fix this error by checking that the object passed to the error handler
        is indeed an instance of Error before accessing the message property.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        When debug is disabled, QEMU's stdio is piped to the parent process. If
        that stream isn't read, it can fill and cause the child process to block
        waiting for the pipe buffer to accept more data.
        Override the default and ignore stdio when debug is not enabled to
        prevent this.

        Refactor Teardown class as TaskQueue to facilitate registering tasks for

        TaskQueue and retains the signal handling from the original object.
        This is a precursor to separating the forking behavior from the suite
        object in preparation for having a standalone runner for virtualized
        workers. For example, we can move the removeDownloads hook from the
        Suite object to a separate SuiteSubprocess object that is specifically
        for handling suites not running on a the same physical machine.

        Compose v2.2 seems to no longer support device_cgroup_rules
        configuration. This was removed in Compose file v3, but it still doesn't
        work with Compose v2.2 even when using the older Compose file v2.4
        that's supposed to support it. Revert to a known good version of
        compose.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        KVM requires support from the CPU, BIOS/firmware, and hypervisor to all
        be enabled. In the case where support is missing or disabled in any of
        these places, KVM cannot be used. If the device node is missing,
        attempting to map it in the compose file will fail, and the worker
        cannot be started.
        Instead, set a device cgroup policy to allow our container to create and
        access the required device nodes at runtime if KVM is supported. This
        allows a fallback to software emulation when KVM is not available. It
        also allows for software emulation of targets not matching the host
        architecture.

- commits:
    - body: >-
        QEMU is able to optionally use OVMF firmware, built from Tianocore edk2,

        to support UEFI. QEMU can be told to load OVMF firmware using a number

        of methods, not all of which fully support persistent UEFI variables,

        such as are required by secure boot.

        Switch from using the -bios flag to fully emulated pflash to load OVMF,

        including support for persistent UEFI variables. Also switch from the pc

        machine to q35, which is required for fully emulated pflash.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        When we removed the dependency on glider in the proxy tests, we also
        removed glider from the worker. However, older versions of the tests
        from ESR branches would still call this endpoint and expect a sane
        response.
        Fortunately, the old proxy tests were invalid and would always pass
        even if glider wasn't working. ICMP traffic does not use the proxy.
        So, we can just pretend to start a glider instance so the old tests
        continue to run, even with an invalid result.

        concurrently.
        From the man page:
        -p, --port=<port>
        Listen on <port> instead of the standard DNS port (53). Setting this to
        zero completely disables DNS function, leaving only DHCP and/or TFTP.
        Specify --port=0 to disable DNS, and allow multiple instances to run
        concurrently.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        Previously, the QEMU worker was setup and controlled through JS bindings
        of libvirt. This package adds an unnecessary abstraction and associated
        complexity. It's no longer maintained, and does not work with current
        and supported versions of Node.
        Spawn QEMU directly using child_process.spawn(). Setup networking
        through a bridge and qemu-bridge-helper, rather than libvirt.

        Docker-compose v2 adds compose functionality to the docker binary

        `docker-compose`, or `docker compose` where appropriate.

    - subject: "patch: Update waitUntil helper's rejection condition to default false"
- commits:
    - body: waitUntil is a helper that runs a function for a designated number of
        times till it satisfies a particular condition to break out of the loop.
        In the current implementation, if `rejectionFail` is `true` and if the
        command fails to satisfy the condition in an iteration then the
        `waitUntil` helper returns an error which isn't quite helpful for a
        function that is meant to continuously wait until something is complete.
        Hence, the change to make `rejectionFail` as default to `false` in the
        `waitUntil` helper

        The class is aimed at representing the action flow of deploying an
        application onto a balena device. From cloning all the way to waiting
        for the application to download.
        One needs to see this class as chain where each node only
        exposes the next possible set moves.

        We need this to be able to specify contracts per test check weather we satisfy them

        before we run the tests. This also cleans up the test API.

    - subject: Refactor SSH connection
- commits:
    - body: >-
        Before requesting an SSH connection from the resin-proxy check if we can
        succesfully establish

        a tunnel to the device, only then attempt the SSH con. This allows us to get an HTTP reponse from

        the socket to establish whether can connect or not.

- commits:
    - body: >-
        Create OS component which provides the required configuration to run a
        specific OS.

        This class will be closely related (coupled) to the worker class. The flash method in the

        worker class will use the OS class to configure the image.

        The two interfaces should be kept in sync.

        Because of the move of the download function we changed the way we retrive the filename.

- commits:
    - body: >-
        The use of ava is becoming more of a hassle than anything.

        Ava is taking a lot of the freedom we have away and we had to

        push back on this until ava cracked.

        Node-tap seems to be a much better fit for this project as it is light-weight and

        highly customizable.

- commits:
    - subject: Add a device-type component with a default implementation
- commits:
    - body: |-
        A "device-type" component implements a "provision" function that given a
        writer, an image, and some options:
        - Flashes the image (in whatever way that makes)
        - Provisions the device (in whatever way that makes sense)
        After the provision function runs, we can expect a device to be up and
        running.
        We provide a default implementation that writes the image to a disk, and
        waits for the test runner person to manually remove the SD Card and
        complete the provisioning process.
        This commit also introduces `utils.requireComponent()`, which will try
        to find a proper implementation, or otherwise default to `default.js`.

    - subject: Present a clear interface to the resin.io SDK component
- commits:
    - body: |-
        The resin.io platform has an interface, which consists of functions such
        as download device type OS, create an application, etc.
        This interface is implemented by the Resin SDK. In the future, we will
        implement the same interface using the Resin CLI, and even the Dashboard
        by using a browser driver technology.
